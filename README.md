# Shila Based ECommerce Application

This is an E-Commerce application planned to display products that my sister made for herself and our family's little daughter Shila. Initially we were planning to have a catalog webpage with a contact info at the bottom but I took this opportunity as a project to develop a fully-fledged E-Commerce web application, so I can learn the principles behind deploying a product from zero.

You can find my first demo through this [link](https://shilaproduct.herokuapp.com/).  
*The app on Heroku is currently free tier, so it might take some time to open the application*
